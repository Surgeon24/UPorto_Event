### 3. Application Help

Help has been implemented in forms, giving the user a real time feedback about the inputs he typed, if they were wrong, and displaying a message on what was supposed to be submitted.

There is also a FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) page where the user can find answers that could help him use the app.

### 4. Input Validation


Input data validation was used in the forms, adding the pattern attribute which displays an error message in case the input was not according to what was expected (Validation Rule). 


For example: when a user is creating an account he has to create a password that contain special characters, numbers, lower and upper case letters. In the server side, there is a verification if the input received is correct by using validators or checking if it is null.

### 7. Revisions to the Project

> Describe the revisions made to the project since the requirements specification stage.  


Some Priorities were changed when we learned about product requirements(features in A9 checklist). User Stories were implemented by order of importance. During production we have had realised that some of the User Stories are unnecessary or of less importance. Giving up some of the User Stories allowed us to focus on more important ones, resulting in having more User Stories (_35_) than initially planned (_29_ see ER component)
