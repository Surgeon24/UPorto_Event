### 3. Application Help

Help has been implemented in forms, giving the user a real time feedback about the inputs he typed, if they were wrong, and displaying a message on what was supposed to be submitted.

There is also a FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) page where the user can see a couple of questions that would help him use the app.

### 4. Input Validation


Input data validation was used in the forms, adding the pattern attribute which displays an error message in case the input was not according to what was expected (Validation Rule). 


For example: when a user is creating an account he has to create a password that contain special characters, numbers, lower and upper case letters. In the server side, there is a verification if the input received is correct by using validators or checking if it is null.
